#House Price Prediction
There are a number of factors which determine property prices, some are logical, based on economic theories and population density and some are based on more intangible factors, like availability of amenities & necessities, neighborhood, etc. Build a linear regression model with stochastic gradient descent to predict the price of the property from the dataset having attributes such as sale type, sale condition etc.

#Lessons Learned
This is the first project I haved worked on, using the basic Linear Regression. It is interesting and was very fulfilling to apply and bring all the theoritical concepts into action. I have tried the same in R, but Python was easier for me to implement.
